# Course Registration System

**Built a CRS during training period of my internship at Flipkart** 

- The goal of this project is to develop a new client-server-based student registration system for Wylie College that replaces the outdated mainframe technology.
  
- This new system will allow students to register for courses and view report cards from personal computers connected to the campus LAN.  

- Professors will have the ability to sign up to teach courses and record grades.  

- The system will integrate with the existing database via the MYSQL interface, ensuring timely access to course information while maintaining the existing course catalog database.  

- Key features include:  
  - **Course registration**  
  - **Schedule adjustment periods**  
  - **Automated billing**
  - **Access to report cards**
  - **Access to add/drop courses for students in a specific time**

This system will enhance efficiency, accessibility, and security for both students and faculty members.
